Evidences obtained from a crime scene are important in solving the case and delivering justice

is of utmost important.

Following are the steps implemented for development of blockchain application:
1.Forensic data transaction proposal from peers: Peers propose adding forensic data to the blockchain.
2.Execution of chaincode: Smart contracts verify and execute the proposed transaction.
3.Transaction proposal response to peers: The outcome of the proposal is sent back to peers and the client.
4.Transaction Submission to Transaction Ordering Service: Accepted transactions are submitted to the Transaction Ordering Service.
5.Transaction ordering: Transactions are sequenced and ordered by the Transaction Ordering Service.
6.Transaction validation: Nodes validate the integrity and compliance of the transactions.
7.Creation of a block: Validated transactions are added to a new block in the blockchain.
